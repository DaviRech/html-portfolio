<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Davi Rech, and I’m passionate about continuous learning and personal growth. I’m currently preparing to return to BYU, where I aim to excel in my studies and become a reference in my field. Education has always been important to me, and I’m committed to achieving high grades and making the most of this opportunity.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, I value family, faith, and community. I’ve been married for 7 years and enjoy spending time with my wife, especially when we’re working on projects together, like renovating our room at the beach house. I also served as a missionary in the Porto Alegre Norte Mission 10 years ago, which was a transformative experience that strengthened my faith and love for service.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’m focused on improving my skills to not only advance in my career but also to help my coworkers and ease their workload. I believe in being a supportive team member and making a positive impact wherever I go.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing games like Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories, practicing English pronunciation, and helping friends like Néfi improve their language skills. I also have a great sense of humor, often joking about being the “favorite child” in my family—a title I proudly wear on custom T-shirts!</p>
<p>Whether in my personal life, studies, or work, I strive to be a positive influence, always learning, growing, and helping others along the way.</p>
